  Citation to discover assets to debtor
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Citation to discover assets to debtor** Easy Form.

  This program helps you make forms to collect a money you won in a court judgment.

  A Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor will require the person or company ordered to pay you to come to court to answer questions about their property and income. You can then try to get that property or income to pay the judgment if it is not protected by law.

  Learn more about [**finding out about a debtor's money, property, and income**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/finding-out-about-debtors-money-property-and-income).

  About the citation
subquestion: |
  A *Citation to discover assets to debtor* tells a debtor to come to court to answer questions about their property and income. After the debtor answers your questions, you can try to get that property or income to pay the judgment.
  
  This citation only applies to the debtor. If you want the debtor's bank or employer to answer questions about the their property and income, you can use ILAO's [**collect a judgment from debtor's bank or employer**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/collect-judgment-debtors-bank-or-employer)
  
  You will need to serve the debtor with the citation. You can use a sheriff or private process server to do this. To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**serving a summons**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/serving-summons).

  Tell us about the amount ${other_parties[0].name.full(middle='full')} still owes you
subquestion: |
  This information is used to figure out how much money you are still owed. This includes the original judgment amount, court costs, interest on the judgment amount, and how much ${other_parties[0].name.full(middle='full')} has already paid you.

  The rate for post-judgment interest is 9% per year. This can be complicated by how much time has passed and if ${other_parties[0].name.full(middle='full')} has paid you part of the judgment. If you do not know how much interest you are owed, you may want to talk with a lawyer.

  If the original judgment said {other_parties[0].name.full(middle='full')} owed you $100 plus court costs, your court costs were $10, and the interest on the judgment was $9, the total amount owed would be $100 plus $10 plus $9, which is $119.

  If {other_parties[0].name.full(middle='full')} had already paid you $30 for that judgment, you would subtract that from the total amount owed. The amount still owed would be $119 minus $30, which is $89.

    <h6 class="alert-heading">What it means to sign your forms</h6>
    <p>By signing your <i>Citation to discover assets</i>, you are certifying that:</p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>Everything on the forms is true and correct, or you have been informed or you believe it is true and correct, and</li>
      <li>You understand that making a false statement on the forms is perjury and has penalties provided by law.</li>
