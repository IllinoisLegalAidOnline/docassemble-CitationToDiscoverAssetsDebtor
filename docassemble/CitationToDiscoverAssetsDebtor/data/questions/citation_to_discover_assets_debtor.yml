  Details about the amount ${other_parties[0].name_full()} still owes you
subquestion: |
  This information is used to figure out how much money you are still owed. This includes the original judgment amount, court costs, interest on the judgment amount, and how much ${other_parties[0].name_full()} has already paid you.
  
  % if (judgment_date > as_datetime('12/31/2019')):
  For judgments entered after 2019, the simple interest rate on the unpaid amount can vary. If the judgment is a **{consumer debt judgment}** of $25,000 or less, the simple interest rate is 5% per year. Otherwise, the simple interest rate is 9% per year. 
  
  Figuring out how much interest you are owed can be complicated by how much time has passed and if ${other_parties[0].name_full()} has paid you part of the judgment. If you do not know how much interest you are owed, you may want to talk with a lawyer.

  The interest rate is calculated as simple interest on the unpaid amount.
  
  Imagine you had a judgment of $1,000 two years ago, and it was not for consumer debt, the simple interest rate would be 9%. You would multiply $1,000 x 9% to get $90 for each year. That would bring the total to $1,180. That’s the amount you can ask for in your citation.

  **Example of an amount still owed**
content: |
  If the original judgment said ${other_parties[0].name_full()} owed you $1,000 plus court costs, here's how the amount still owed could be calculated:

  * Original judgment: $1,000
  * Court costs: $90
  * Interest on judgment: $90 (9% of $1,000)
  
  The total amount owed would be $1,000 plus $90 plus $90, which is $1,180.

  If ${other_parties[0].name_full()} had already paid you $300 for that judgment, you would subtract that from the total amount owed. The amount still owed would be $1,180 minus $300, which is $880.
